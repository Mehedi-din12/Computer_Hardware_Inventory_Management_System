# Computer_Hardware_Inventory_Management_System

This is a project of Java and Object Oriented Programing course using JavaFX

Overview: I developed a Computer Hardware Inventory Management System for efficient inventory tracking and management. The system includes secure admin login, enabling admins to oversee purchases, shipments, and inventory details (type, name, price, stock levels). Using an ArrayList, it supports product search, sorting, and quick navigation between sections, with purchase and shipment histories saved in data files for easy access.
